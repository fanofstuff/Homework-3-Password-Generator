# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This program is intended to dynamically generate a password of varying lengths based on a user-defined character set. Specifically, users can choose to generate passwords between 8 and 128 characters long using any combination of numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters. 

## Intended Usage

According to the user story that came bundled with this project, the intent of this program is to provide an employee with access to sensitive information a way to randomly generate passwords that they can then use to deter would-be information thieves. In reality, of course, using something like Math.random as the basis for this kind of security is just asking for trouble nowadays. Still, for a more mundane usage - deterring one's snoopy cubicle-neighbor from accessing your computer, say - this could be useful.
